## PyINPUT\_RECORD Object

Interface to the INPUT\_RECORD struct used with console IO functions\.  Create using PyINPUT\_RECORDType\(EventType\)

#### Comments

Only attributes that apply to each particular EventType can be accessed:
 

KEY\_EVENT: KeyDown, RepeatCount, VirtualKeyCode, VirtualScanCode, ControlKeyState
 

MOUSE\_EVENT: MousePosition, ButtonState, ControlKeyState, EventFlags
 

WINDOW\_BUFFER\_SIZE\_EVENT: Size
 

FOCUS\_EVENT: SetFocus
 

MENU\_EVENT: CommandId

#### Properties

  - int EventType

    One of KEY\_EVENT, MOUSE\_EVENT, WINDOW\_BUFFER\_SIZE\_EVENT, MENU\_EVENT, FOCUS\_EVENT\. Cannot be changed after object is created

  - boolean KeyDown

    True for a key press, False for key release

  - int RepeatCount

    Nbr of repeats generated \(key was held down if &gt1\)

  - int VirtualKeyCode

    Device-independent key code, win32con\.VK\_\*

  - int VirtualScanCode

    Device-dependent scan code generated by keyboard

  - [PyUnicode](PyUnicode.md) Char

    Single unicode character generated by the keypress

  - int ControlKeyState

    State of modifier keys, combination of CAPSLOCK\_ON, ENHANCED\_KEY, LEFT\_ALT\_PRESSED, 

LEFT\_CTRL\_PRESSED, NUMLOCK\_ON, RIGHT\_ALT\_PRESSED, RIGHT\_CTRL\_PRESSED, SCROLLLOCK\_ON, SHIFT\_PRESSED

  - int ButtonState

    Bitmask representing which mouse buttons were pressed\.

  - int EventFlags

    DOUBLE\_CLICK, MOUSE\_MOVED or MOUSE\_WHEELED, or 0\.  If 0, indicates a mouse button press

  - [PyCOORD](PyCOORD.md) MousePosition

    Position in character coordinates

  - [PyCOORD](PyCOORD.md) Size

    New size of screen buffer in character rows/columns

  - boolean SetFocus

    Reserved - Used only with type FOCUS\_EVENT\.  This event is Reserved, and should be ignored\.

  - int CommandId

    Used only with event type MENU\_EVENT, which is reserved and should not be used
