# PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer


## PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer Object

An alias for a standard Python buffer object\. 

Previous versions of the Windows extensions had a custom object for 

holding a read buffer\.  This has been replaced with the standard Python buffer object\. 

Python does not provide a method for creating a read-write buffer 

of arbitary size, so currently this can only be created by [win32file::AllocateReadBuffer](win32file.md#win32fileallocatereadbuffer)\.
