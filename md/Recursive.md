# Recursive


## Recursive directory deletes and special files

Python's win32 access for file properties to enable deletes

Sometimes you may want to do something like remove entire 

directory trees\. Python has some great utilities to do that, except 

files with special attributes cannot be typically deleted\.

To get around this problem you need to use the win32 call to 

SetFileAttributes to be a normal file\.

The C\+\+ call looks like this:

BOOL SetFileAttributes\( 

LPCTSTR lpFileName, 

DWORD dwFileAttributes 

\);

You provide it 2 arguments the filename and the specific attributes 

and it returns whether or not it succeeded\.

The corresponding python call is: 

int = win32api\.SetFileAttributes\( pathName, attrs \)

The only question is where do you get attrs\. It is included in the 

ever handy win32con module specifically -- 

win32con\.FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_\*\. You can set a file to be read only, 

archive, hidden, etc\. We are concerned with setting it back to normal, 

so we want: win32con\.FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_NORMAL

The example below can be useful, but, of course, be careful with it, 

since it deletes a lot of stuff\. It is a recursive function  The example 

also makes use of some handy functions from the os module\.

#### Example
Here is a basic example of how to remove a directory tree:

import win32con

import win32api

import os

def del\_dir\(self,path\):

&\#09for file in os\.listdir\(path\):

&\#09&\#09file\_or\_dir = os\.path\.join\(path,file\)

&\#09&\#09if os\.path\.isdir\(file\_or\_dir\) and not os\.path\.islink\(file\_or\_dir\):

&\#09&\#09&\#09del\_dir\(file\_or\_dir\) \#it's a directory reucursive call to function again

&\#09&\#09else:

&\#09&\#09&\#09try:

&\#09&\#09&\#09&\#09os\.remove\(file\_or\_dir\) \#it's a file, delete it

&\#09&\#09&\#09except:

&\#09&\#09&\#09&\#09\#probably failed because it is not a normal file

&\#09&\#09&\#09&\#09win32api\.SetFileAttributes\(file\_or\_dir, win32con\.FILE\_ATTRIBUTE\_NORMAL\)

&\#09&\#09&\#09&\#09os\.remove\(file\_or\_dir\) \#it's a file, delete it

&\#09&\#09os\.rmdir\(path\) \#delete the directory here

Have a great time with programming with python\!
