# STATSTG


## STATSTG Object

A tuple representing a STATSTG structure

#### Items

  - \[0\] string : name

    The name of the storage object

  - \[1\] int : type

    Indicates the type of storage object\. This is one of the values from the storagecon\.STGTY\_\* values\.

  - \[2\] [ULARGE\_INTEGER](ULARGE.md#ulargeinteger) : size

    Specifies the size in bytes of the stream or byte array\.

  - \[3\] [PyTime](PyTime.md) : modificationTime

    Indicates the last modification time for this storage, stream, or byte array\.

  - \[4\] [PyTime](PyTime.md) : creationTime

    Indicates the creation time for this storage, stream, or byte array\.

  - \[5\] [PyTime](PyTime.md) : accessTime

    Indicates the last access time for this storage, stream or byte array\.

  - \[6\] int : mode

    Indicates the access mode specified when the object was opened\. This member is only valid in calls to Stat methods\.

  - \[7\] int : locksSupported

    Indicates the types of region locking supported by the stream or byte array\. See the storagecon\.LOCKTYPES\_\* constants for the values available\. This member is not used for storage objects\.

  - \[8\] [PyIID](PyIID.md) : clsid

    Indicates the class identifier for the storage object; set to CLSID\_NULL for new storage objects\. This member is not used for streams or byte arrays\.

  - \[9\] int : stateBits

    Indicates the current state bits of the storage object, that is, the value most recently set by the [PyIStorage::SetStateBits](PyIStorage.md#pyistoragesetstatebits) method\. This member is not valid for streams or byte arrays\.

  - \[10\] int : storageFormat

    Indicates the format of the storage object\. This is one of the values from the STGFMT\_\* constants\.  In some Win32 API documentation, this member is known as 'reserved'
