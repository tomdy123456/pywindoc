# PyIPropertyBag


## PyIPropertyBag Object

A Python wrapper for a COM IPropertyBag interface\.

#### Comments

The IPropertyBag interface provides an object with a property bag in which the object can persistently save its properties\.
 

When a client wishes to have exact control over how individually named properties of an object are saved, it would attempt to use an object's IPersistPropertyBag interface as a persistence mechanism\. In that case the client supplies a property bag to the object in the form of an IPropertyBag interface\.

#### Methods

  - [Read](PyIPropertyBag.md#pyipropertybagread)

    Called by the control to read a property from the storage provided by the container\.&nbsp;

  - [Write](PyIPropertyBag.md#pyipropertybagwrite)

    Called by the control to write each property in turn to the storage provided by the container\.&nbsp;




## [PyIPropertyBag](PyIPropertyBag.md#pyipropertybag)\.Read

object = Read\(propName, propType

, errorLog

\)
Called by the control to read a property from the storage provided by the container\.

#### Parameters

  - propName : str

    Name of the property to read\.

  - propType : int

    The type of the object to read\.  Must be a VT\_\* Variant Type constant\.

  - errorLog=None : [PyIErrorLog](PyIErrorLog.md)

    The caller's [PyIErrorLog](PyIErrorLog.md) object in which the property bag stores any errors that occur during reads\. Can be None in which case the caller is not interested in errors\.

#### Comments

The result is a Python object, mapped from a COM VARIANT of type as specified in the propType parameter\.


## [PyIPropertyBag](PyIPropertyBag.md#pyipropertybag)\.Write

Write\(propName, value\)
Called by the control to write each property in turn to the storage provided by the container\.

#### Parameters

  - propName : str

    Name of the property to read\.

  - value : object

    The value for the property\.  The value must be able to be converted to a COM VARIANT\.
